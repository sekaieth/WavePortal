# WavePortal

WavePortal is a tutorial project from [https://buildspace.so](Buildspace).  This is a fun little project to get familiar with Solidity and React.

## What is it?
A full-stack Dapp to allow people to connect their wallets to send a wave and a message to you through a smart contract.  Pretty neat!
